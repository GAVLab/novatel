Novatel GPS Driver
==================
  
This project provides a cross-platform interface for the Novatel OEM4 and OEMV series of GPS receivers.  The Novatel SPAN system is also supported. 

The Novatel driver is written as a standlone library which depends on [Boost](http://http://www.boost.org) and a simple cross-platform serial port library [serial port library](https://github.com/wjwwood/serial).  It uses [Cmake](http://http://www.cmake.org) for the build system.  Example programs are provided that demonstrate the basic functionality of the library.

The driver can optionally be built using [Catkin](http://www.ros.org/wiki/catkin) and includes a [ROS](http://www.ros.org) node that reads from the sensor and publishes [NavSatFix](http://ros.org/doc/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/NavSatFix.html) and [Odometry](http://ros.org/doc/api/nav_msgs/html/msg/Odometry.html) messages.    

# Installation 

## ROS Install

The serial and Novatel packages are both "wet" packages and require Catkin.  To build the libraries, first create a Catkin workspace (you can skip this step if you are adding the packages to an existing workspace.)

	mkdir -p ~/novatel_ws/src
	cd ~/novatel_ws/src
	catkin_init_workspace
	wstool init ./
	
Next, add the Serial, GPS Messages, and Novatel packages to the workspace:

	wstool set serial --git git@github.com:wjwwood/serial.git
	wstool set novatel --git git@github.com:GAVLab/novatel.git
	wstool set gps_msgs --git git@github.com:GAVLab/gps-msgs.git
	wstool update

Finally, build the packages:

	cd ../
	catkin_make


## Standalone Install

Although Catkin is the preferred build method, both packages can be installed without Catkin.  An older version of the serial library can be installed using the instructions below:

	git clone git://github.com/wjwwood/serial.git
	cd serial
	git checkout fuerte
	make
	sudo make install
	
Next, the Novatel library can be installed by:

	git clone git@github.com:GAVLab/novatel.git
	cd novatel
	make
	sudo make install
	
The above commands will build and install the Novatel static library.  To also build an example program for testing the interface:

	cd build
	cmake ../ -DNOVATEL_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON
	make
	
To build the optional Novatel tests:

	cd build
	cmake ../ -DNOVATEL_BUILD_TESTS=ON
	make
